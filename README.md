#Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering
-
**Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.**
*Software engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software systems and products using engineering principles.*

**Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.**
1. Development of programming languages
2.  Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
3.  Advent of structured programming in the 1970s.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Requirements: gathering and documenting user's needs and requirements.
- Design: creating designs for the software architecture and user intwrface.
- Implementation: writing code and building the software.
- Testing: to check the quality of the built software.
- Deployment: releasing the software to users.
- Maintenance: ensuring that the software runs smoothly.

**Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.**
*Waterfall and agile methodologies are among the top software development methodologies. Waterfall methodology has a linear approach, with the phases flowing sequentially while agile methodology has an iterative and incremental approach focusing on flexibility, collaboration and responding to change.*

**Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.**
- A software developer writes code and implements software solutions.
- A quality assurance engineer ensures software quality by designing and executing text plans.
- A project manager oversees the planning, wxecution and delivery of software projects.


**Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.**
- IDEs provide tools for writing, debuging and testing codes and VCS track changes to source codeand coordinate work among members.

**What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.**
- Changing requirements
- Tight deadlines
- Technical dept

**Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.**
- Unit testing: testing individual components of a software.
- Integretion testing: testing interactions between different components.
- System testing: testing the whole system.
- Acceptance testing: Atesting if the software meets user's needs.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
-

**Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.**
- Prompt engineering is coming up with appropriate questions to get the best response from AI models.

**Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.**
- Vague prompt: cooking noodles. Improved prompt: a step by step guide on how to correctly cook indomie instant noodles in three minutes.
- The improved prompt is more effective because it gives clear instructions on how to cook a specific type of noodles and is comprehensive.
